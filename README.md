# BG3-Baseliner

**Issue:**  
Patch 7 Introduces progression merging to improve compatibility, however it does not function as planned due to Multiclass nodes.

**Possible Workaround:**  
Include all base game class progressions with additional multiclass nodes, providing a solid base for us to work from?

> ### Progression Merge Issues
> #### Version: 4.1.1.5932596

> There appears to be an issue with progression merges that are not at level 1 and multiclassing.
> 
> A theory is that the when a progression merge occurs, it will create a separate "Multiclass" node, leading to some features not being included.
